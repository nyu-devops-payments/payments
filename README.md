# Brief Description of the Repository

This repository is the hub for a RESTful microservice that handles Payments for an eCommerce website. 
The website is being developed by NYU's DevOps and Agile Methodologies class (Fall 2018).

The Payments resource is responsible for processing all payment-related operations. These include operations such as a customer picking his/her payment method, payment authorization, printing/emailing receipts, etc.
